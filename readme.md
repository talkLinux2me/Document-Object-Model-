Hello Steven and future developers,

Here is a project I am working on that I actually would like to see come to life. 
It is a webpage that will guide visually impaired people on walks around their cities and neighborhoods.
It will have the volume permanently on and fully accessible through voice recognition.
It will have a live interactive map with warnings on fire hydrants, high curbs, light poles and many other potentially hazardous conditions.
Please enjoy and feel free to leave feedback.
