        Thank you for joining us today. We are a walking route guidance app 
        with live tracking and up to date safety warnings. Volume and accessibility is 
        always enabled and may only be disabled via voice recognition. 
        Walk, ride, glide or roll at your own pace and enjoy a worry free experience 
        as you explore your city.
